# functionapp-pwsh-azcli

This repo shows how to use the Azure CLI in a PowerShell function.
Leveraging GitHub actions, it provides a working end-to-end example of the [steps required](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-powershell-worker/issues/221) to get the Azure CLI working inside a PowerShell function.

The [GitHub Action Workflow](.github/workflows/deployPwshFnApp.yml) orchestrates the steps inside an empty Azure environment.
